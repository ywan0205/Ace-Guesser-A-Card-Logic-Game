## üéÆ How to Play

1. The system randomly chooses a card from a standard 52-card deck (value + suit).
2. You have **10 attempts** to guess the correct card.
3. Input your guess in the format: `Value,Suit`  
   Example: `10,Hearts` or `Queen,Spades`
4. After each guess, you'll receive detailed feedback:
   - Whether the value is too high, too low, or correct.
   - Whether the suit is too high, too low, or correct.
5. You earn up to **100 points**, with **-10 points** per wrong guess.
6. After each guess, remaining attempts and current score will be shown.
7. At the end of the game, you'll receive a performance evaluation (e.g., Excellent, Great Job, etc.)
